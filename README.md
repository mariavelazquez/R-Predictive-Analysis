# R-Predictive-Analysis

In this project, I examined the complex dynamics of house prices using R. I employed regression analysis techniques to predict house prices based on key variables such as total area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, and amenities like air conditioning and heating systems. Additionally, I converted the ‘Price’ variable into a qualitative feature, categorizing it as either ‘high’ or ‘low’ based on certain criteria, to simplify the interpretation of its impact on other factors influencing house prices.
